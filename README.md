# Embedded Image Creator

This tool is creating a C-style header file containing different RAW formats (RGB888, RGB565, Grayscale) of the input image. It is pretty useful if you need to embed image into C/C++ software.

## Usage

```
./convert-img-to-c-header.py <input_image>
```

You will get a `output-header/raw_images.h`
